\section{Introduction}
Minimizing the erosion of sediment into streams is a goal for water quality managers. In order to develop plans to limit the amount of sediment that gets into streams, those managers need to know how sediment gets into the water. A recent study \cite{Danz:2010} has shown that 

The next block of code produces a set of bar charts that show the relative contributions of the snow-driven events, post-snow-pre-vegetation events, and the post-vegetation events.\\
