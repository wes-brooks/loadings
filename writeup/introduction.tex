\section{Introduction}
Minimizing the erosion of sediment into streams is a goal for watershed managers. In order to mitigate the harmful effects of erosion and sediment runoff, managers need an accurate idea of how inputs like rainfall and snowmelt affect the amount of sediment carried in the stream.\\

The sediment load carried in a stream is not constant in time; a recent study \cite{Danz:2010} has shown that most of the annual load is carried in just a few days when the stream is heavily loaded with sediment. The same is true for the phosphorus load. Our interest is in using a few simple input variables to model the load carried by a stream.\\
