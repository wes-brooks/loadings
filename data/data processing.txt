Excel formula for turning start date into julian date (year and month are already provided)
=AC2-DATE(YEAR(AC2)-1,12,31)

Transformations on julian date: sine and cosine. Done in Excel at the same time as the julian date is computed.
=SIN(AE2*2*PI()/365)
=COS(AE2*2*PI()/365)

Added columns to the csv file for log transformed loadings - all of the phosphorus and suspended solids loads:
=log10(AF2+0.01)

Look in code directory (../code) for split.py, which separates each data set into snow events and non-snow events. Right now it is hard-coded for the eaglecreek data

'Aggregate' is the file that stores data for all the creeks.
